ABOUT

  This package comtains 2 sets of code, a command-line utility used to
generate a TSS key blob and write it to disk and an OpenSSL engine which
interfaces with the TSS API.

BUILDING

 By default, the build will assume that you have a custom openssl installed
in /usr/local/ssl.

 $ configure [--enable-debug] [--with-openssl=/path/to/custom/openssl]
 $ make
 # make install

RUNNING

create_tpm_key

        create_tpm_key: create a TPM key and write it to disk
        usage: create_tpm_key [options] <filename>

        Options:
                -e|--enc-scheme encryption scheme to use [PKCSV15] or OAEP
                -q|--sig-scheme signature scheme to use [DER] or SHA1
                -s|--key-size   key size in bits [2048]
                -a|--auth       require a password for the key [NO]
                -p|--popup      use TSS GUI popup dialogs to get the password
				for the key [NO] (implies --auth)

  Key type:  The TPM key type of the key created will be legacy, so that it can
be used for both signing and encryption.

  Padding schemes:  Choosing the encryption and signature schemes
at key creation time is mandatory because of the structure of a TPM key blob.
Once a key is created by the TPM, the encryption and signature schemes are set
in store and cannot be changed without corrupting the key (making it unloadable
into a TPM). Here are the trade-offs:

* PKCSV15 encryption scheme - all encrypted data will be padded using the
    PKCSv1.5 padding algorithm. OAEP padding is considered more secure, but
    many legacy apps will require PKCSv1.5 (most notably openssl). PKCSV15
    padding will also allow a slightly larger chunk of data to be encrypted in
    one operation.
  OAEP encryption scheme - all encrypted data will be padded using the OAEP
    padding algorithm.

* DER signature scheme - assumes data to be signed is DER encoded (although
    this is not required). Will allow signatures to be made of arbitrary
    size, up to the size the padding will allow.
  SHA1 signature scheme - assumes *all* data to be signed is a SHA1 hash.
    This restricts the data size to be signed to 20 bytes, always.

* default

  Key sizes: Default=2048 bits. Other valid sizes are 512 and 1024 bits.

  Key auth: Default=none. if -a is specified, you will be prompted on the
command line using OpenSSL for a passphrase. This passphrase is SHA1 hashed
by the TSS and used as the key's password. At key load time, you'll be
prompted for the passphrase again by OpenSSL. If -p is psecified, you'll get
a GUI  prompt for password. WARNING: The TSS spec requires passwords input
into a popup be converted to UTF16, then hashed using SHA1. This means that
unless you manually convert your passphrase to UTF16 before passing it to
the TSS, there'll be no way to input your passphrase correctly unless you use
the GUI popup with the TSS. This is still being worked on in the OpenSSL
engine code. Perhaps I can make the secret input popups an option in the
engine's control commands. [TODO]

OpenSSL TPM engine

  Included in this package is a sample openssl.cnf file, which can be used
to turn on use of the TPM engine in apps where OpenSSL config support is
compiled in.



USE CASES

  If there's a use case for the TPM engine that you'd like to see it support,
please drop a line to trousers-users@lists.sf.net.

USES

Create a self-signed cert using the TPM engine:

1. Generate a TPM key and write it to a file:
 $ create_tpm_key <keyfilename>

2. Make the openssl certificate request:
 $ openssl req -keyform engine -engine tpm -key <keyfilename> -new -x509 -days 365 -out <certfilename>

3. Test using openssl:
 $ openssl s_server -cert <certfilename> -www -accept 4433 -keyform engine -engine tpm -key <keyfilename>
 $ konqueror https://localhost:4433
